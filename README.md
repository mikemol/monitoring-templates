# monitoring-templates

Monitoring templates I'm building or collecting. Focus is on Zabbix, though may expand.

## Purpose, usage and SLA

I'm make no guarantees or implications of repeatability, uitility or fitness. Heck, I'm not even putting branch protections on the `master` branch yet.

That said, if something crosses your mind, feel free to file an issue. I'll happily discuss it, but I make no promises to act on it.

My hope is that this material is found useful, informative, perhaps even instructive. But be aware I enjoy building things for the sake of building them, so I make no guarantees of practicality. That said, I'll try to keep these resources up-to-date as I improve on them.

## Useful tools

This is a non-exhaustive list of tools I use (or have used) while maintaining this repository:

- Libreoffice Calc
- [snmpwalk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/snmpwalk)
- Visual Studio Code
  - [Edit csv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv)
  - [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
  - [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
  - [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)
- Zabbix

Maybe I'll document how/why I used various tools at various times, but maybe not.
